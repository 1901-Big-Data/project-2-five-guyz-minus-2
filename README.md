Our project consisted of finding a large set of raw data, transforming and sqooping that data to Hive, 
using Hive to perform business-relevant analysis, and then visualizing and presenting our findings to the group.

The following is a more detailed step-by-step flow of our project:
  1. find an interesting dataset that is large and at least semi-structured
  2. formulate at least 5 interesting or business-relevant questions to be answered based on the data from the dataset
  3. setup an RDS with a schema that can fit the dataset
  4. clean the data
  5. use Sqoop to transport the data to the RDS
  6. use Sqoop to transport the data from RDS to Hive
  7. use Hive on the dataset to answer the questions
  8. output findings into a file
  9. use visualization software of choice to visualize the data
  10. put the project story and findings into an elegant powerpoint presentation
